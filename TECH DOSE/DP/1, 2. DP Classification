1. What is Dynamic Programming | When do we use dynamic programming

DP is optimization over plain recursion.

Conditions that need to be fulfilled to apply DP on problems:
1) Repeating Subproblems
- The subproblems should be repeating.
2) Optimal Substructure
- The problem when divided into many subproblems; When each subproblem is solved, the main problem should be solved.
