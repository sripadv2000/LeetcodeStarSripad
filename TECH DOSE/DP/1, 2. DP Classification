1. What is Dynamic Programming | When do we use dynamic programming

DP is optimization over plain recursion.

Conditions that need to be fulfilled to apply DP on problems:
1) Repeating Subproblems
- The subproblems should be repeating.
2) Optimal Substructure
- The problem when divided into many subproblems; When each subproblem is solved, the main problem should be solved.

2. Dynamic Programming Classification
Types of DP:
1) Knapsack 
  i) 01
  ii)Bounded
  iii)Unbounded
2) LCS
3) LIS
4) Matrix Chain Multiplication
5) DP on Grid
6) Kadane's Algorithm
7) Others

Advanced DP 
1) DP on Kth lexicographic string
2) DP on Tree
3) DP + Bitmasking
4) DP + BIT/Segment Tree
5) DP + Convex Hull
6) DP Preprocessing
7) DP + Trie
8) DP + GEOMETRY
9) DP + BINARY SEARCH
10) DP + Knuth Optimization
