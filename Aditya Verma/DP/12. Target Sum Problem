12) Target Sum Problem
P: https://leetcode.com/problems/target-sum/solution/

Given a list of non-negative integers, a1, a2, ..., an, and a target, S. Now you have 2 symbols + and -. 
For each integer, you should choose one from + and - as its new symbol.

Find out how many ways to assign symbols to make sum of integers equal to target S.

Example 1:
Input: nums is [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], S is 3. 
Output: 5
Explanation: 

-1+1+1+1+1 = 3
+1-1+1+1+1 = 3
+1+1-1+1+1 = 3
+1+1+1-1+1 = 3
+1+1+1+1-1 = 3

There are 5 ways to assign symbols to make the sum of nums be target 3.

Instead of approaching the problem in the given way, see it from other side.
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1] array can be divided into 2 subsets:  +[1, 1, 1, 1] and -[1] and the difference is given as 3.

So this is nothing but COUNT THE NUMBER OF SUBSET SUM WITH GIVEN DIFFERENCE.
