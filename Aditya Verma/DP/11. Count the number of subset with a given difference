11) Count the number of subset with a given difference

Given an array and a variable Difference.
Divide the array into 2 subsets such that the difference of their sum equals Difference. Find the number of such subsets.

Let the sum of subsets be s1 and s2.

(s1 - s2) = Diff
(s1 + s2) = sum(arr)
Adding the rwo equations,
2*(s1) = Diff + sum(arr)

Therefore, s1 = (Diff + sum(arr))/2

In RHS, Given Diff and given arr so can calculate sum, Just can calculate s1.

With s1, we just have to FIND THE COUNT OF SUBSETSUM WITH S1.

return CountofSubsetSum(arr,sum)

If (Diff + sum(arr)) is odd, then return 0;
