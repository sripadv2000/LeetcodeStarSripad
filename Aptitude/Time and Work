A takes n days to do a work of w units. B takes m days to do a work of w units.
So the rate at which A works = (w/n) units/day
So the rate at which B works = (w/m) units/day
If A and B work together, the rate at which they work together = w(m+n)/mn units/day.
I in 1 day they are doing w(m+n)/mn units of work, then w units of work can be done in mn/(m+n) days.

Note: The time taken by A+B together is mn/(m+n) only dependent on m and n and importantly independent of w.

Q) A can do a work in 4 days. B can do the same work in 12 days. In how many days will they complete the work if they work together?
Sol) By using the formula, we can directly tell that it is mn/(m+n) = 4*12/(4+12) = 48/16 = 3
But formula is not prefered. This may work for this case but it will fail in other questions.
Method-2: Take a multiple of m and n. Need not be LCM.
Assume total Work = 12 units
Rate at which A works = 12/4 = 3 units/day
Rate at which B works = 12/12 = 1 units/day
Total units of work per day = 3+1 = 4 units/day
So in 1 day if 4 units is done, then
      ? days  12 units is done
In 3 days, 12 units can be done. Answer is 3.

Q) If A can do a work in 10 days and A and B together can complete the same work in 6 days, how many days will B alone will take?
By using the formula or by equating the rates, (1/6) = (1/10) + (1/x) -> x= 15 days.
Or w/o using the formula, Assume total Work = 60 units
Rate at which A works = 60/10 = 6 units/day
Rate at which B works = 60/x units/day
Total units of work per day = 60/6 = 10 units/day
6+(60/x) = 10
(60/x) = 4
x=15

Q) P can do a work in 6hrs and Q can do the work in 12hrs. Q started the work and Q joined him after 3hrs. How much time in all will they take to complete the work?
Assume total Work = 60 units
Rate at which P works = 60/6 = 10 units/hr
Rate at which Q works = 60/12 = 5 units/hr
Q joins after 3 hrs. Meanwhile, P completes 10*3 = 30 units of work in 3 hrs.
After 3 hrs, Q joins. Rate becomes 10+5 = 15 units/hr
So the remaining 60-30 = 30 units can be completed in 30/15 = 2 hrs.
In total, it takes 5 hrs time.

Q) A and B can complete a task in 20 days.
B and C can complete a task in 30 days.
A and C can complete a task in 40 days.
What is the ratio of number of days taken by A when completing the same task alone to the number of days taken by C when completing the same task alone?
Sol) Assume total Work = 120 units
Rate at which A+B work = 120/20 = 6 units/day
Rate at which B+C work = 120/30 = 4 units/day
Rate at which A+C work = 120/40 = 3 units/day
Rate at which A+B+C work = (6+4+3)/2 = 13/2 units/day
Rate at which A works = (13/2)-4 = 5/2 units/day
Rate at which C works = (13/2)-6 = 1/2 units/day
Rate/Speed is inversely proportional to time.
So Days taken by A : Days taken by C = Rate at which C works : Rate at which A works
Answer is 1:5

Q) A can do a work in 30 days and B can do the same work in 45 days. A started the work and B replaced him after 14 days. 
In how many days from beginning 80% work will be completed?
Sol) Assume total Work = 90 units
Rate at which A works = 90/30 = 3 units/day
Rate at which B works = 90/45 = 2 units/day
A works for 14 days completes 14*3 = 42 units.
80% of total work  = 80% * 90 = 72 units.
42 units completed by A.
Remaining 30 units.
B can complete 30 units in 30/2 = 15 days.
So in total it takes 14+15 = 29 days to complete 80% of the work.

Q) A can do a work in 3 days and B can do the same work in 6 days. If A and B are working on alternate days. A on first day, B on 2nd again A on 3rd and so on.
In how many days the work will be completed?
Sol) Assume total Work = 12 units
Rate at which A works = 12/3 = 4 units/day
Rate at which B works = 12/6 = 2 units/day
To complete 12 units of work by A and B alternately, 4+2+4+2 = 12 units completed in 4 days.
Answer is 4.
When the work is big, we cannot manually calculate the days. So take each (4+2) as one turn.
Turn = 6; Total 12 units can be completed in 2 turns; And each turn has 2 days; So it takes Turns*2 = 4 days.
Take care when we get fractional days.

Q) A can do a work in 15 days and B can do the same work in 10 days. If A and B are working on alternate days. A on first day, B on 2nd again A on 3rd and so on.
In how many days the work will be completed?
Sol) Assume total Work = 90 units
Rate at which A works = 90/15 = 6 units/day
Rate at which B works = 90/10 = 9 units/day
Turn = (6+9) = 15 units/day
Entire 90 units can be completed in 90/15 = 6 turns
So it takes 6*2 = 12 days.

Q) A can do a work in 25 days and B can do the same work in 15 days. If A and B are working on alternate days. A on first day, B on 2nd again A on 3rd and so on.
In how many days the work will be completed?
Sol) Assume total Work = 150 units
Rate at which A works = 150/25 = 6 units/day
Rate at which B works = 150/15 = 10 units/day
Turn  = (6+10) = 16 units/day
Entire 150 units can be completed in 150/16 = (9)6/16 turns
It takes 9 complete turns and 6 units left for A to exactly complete.
So it takes 2*9 + 1 = 19 days.

Q) A can do a work in 25 days and B can do the same work in 15 days. If A and B are working on alternate days. B on first day, A on 2nd again B on 3rd and so on.
In how many days the work will be completed?
Sol) Assume total Work = 150 units
Rate at which A works = 150/25 = 6 units/day
Rate at which B works = 150/15 = 10 units/day
Turn  = (6+10) = 16 units/day
Entire 150 units can be completed in 150/16 = (9)6/16 turns
It takes 9 complete turns and 6 units left for B to complete.
B can complete 10 units of work in a  day.
To do 6 units of work, it takes 6/10 th time of a day.
So it takes 2*9 + (6/10) = (18)3/5 days or 93/5 days.

Q) A can do a work in 9 days and B can do the same work in 6 days. If A and B are working on alternate days. A on first day, B on 2nd again A on 3rd and so on.
In how many days the work will be completed?
Sol) Assume total Work = 90 units
Rate at which A works = 90/9 = 10 units/day
Rate at which B works = 90/6 = 15 units/day
Turn  = (10+15) = 25 units/day
Entire 90 units can be completed in 90/25 = (3)15/25 turns
It takes 3 complete turns and 15 units left.
In 1 more day, A completes 10 units of work with 5 left.
For 5 units to complete, B takes 5/15 = 1/3 day
So it takes 2*3 + 1 + 1/3 = (7)1/3 days or 22/3 days.

Q) A can do a work in 9 days and B can do the same work in 6 days. If A and B are working on alternate days. B on first day, A on 2nd again B on 3rd and so on.
In how many days the work will be completed?
Sol) Assume total Work = 90 units
Rate at which A works = 90/9 = 10 units/day
Rate at which B works = 90/6 = 15 units/day
Turn  = (10+15) = 25 units/day
Entire 90 units can be completed in 90/25 = (3)15/25 turns
It takes 3 complete turns and 15 units left.
In 1 more day, B exactly completes 15 units of work.
So it takes 2*3 + 1 = 7 days.

Q) Tap A can fill the tank in 15hrs whereas B can fill the tank in 30hrs. If both the tanks are opened simultaneously, how much time does it take to fill the tank?
Sol) Let the capacity of tank be 150 L.
Rate at which A can fill 150/15 = 10 L/hr.
Rate at which B can fill 150/30 = 5 L/hr.
Rate at which A+B can fill 10+5 = 15 L/hr.
So in 1 hr, A+B can fill 15L;
So 150L can be filled in 150/15 = 10hrs.

Q) An inlet tap A can fill the tank in 10hrs and an outlet tap B can empty the tank in 30hrs. If both the tanks are opened simultaneously,in how much time the tank gets full?
Sol) Let the capacity of tank be 90 L.
Rate at which A can fill 90/10 = 9 L/hr.(Inflow)
Rate at which B can empty 90/30 = 3 L/hr.(Outflow)
Rate at which A+B can fill 9-3 = 6 L/hr.
So in 1 hr, A+B can fill 6L;
So 90L can be filled in 90/6 = 15hrs.
Whenever the Outflow is greater than Inflow, the time taken will be infinity.

Q) A pump can fill the tank with water in 2hrs. Because of a leak, it took (2)1/3 hours to fill the tank. The leak can drain all the water in the tank in?
Sol) Let the capacity of tank = 14 L
Rate at which A can fill = 7 L/hr
Rate at which A+leak can fill the tank = 14 / (7/3) = 6 L/hr
Rate at which leak empties = 7-6 = 1 L/hr.
Therefore the leak can drain all the water in 14hrs.
