11) Best Time to BUY and SELL STOCK
   P: https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/
   Method-1:
	Brute-Force Approach: TC: O(n^2); SC: O(1)
	For each item, traverse the whole right part and maintain a variable which stores the maximum difference.
   Method-2:
	One Pass. TC: O(n); SC: O(1)
	Just 2 variables one for keeping track of minimum element till then and one for maximum profit.
	Kinda Kadane Algorithm based approach.
Code:
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        maxi=0
        mini=prices[0]
        for i in prices:
            if(i<mini):
                mini=i
            if( i -mini > maxi):
                maxi= i-mini
        return maxi
