30) Add Two Numbers Given as LinkedLists
    P: https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/
    
Method-1: TC:O(max(n1,n2)); SC: O(max(n1,n2))
Create a dummy node for answer LL. Using variables sum and carry, compute the value at the answer node.
If any of the value of LLs or carry exists, then perform the addition operations.
carry=sum//10 and and add only sum%10 to the LL. dummy.next is the head of the resultant LL
and to complete the LL, we use the temp pointer.

Code:
class Solution:
    def addTwoNumbers(self, l1: ListNode, l2: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        dummy = ListNode()
        temp = dummy
        carry = 0
        while(l1!=None or l2!=None or carry):
            sum = 0
            if(l1!=None):
                sum+=l1.val
                l1 = l1.next
            if(l2!=None):
                sum+=l2.val
                l2 = l2.next
            sum += carry
            carry = sum//10
            node = ListNode(sum%10)
            temp.next = node
            temp = temp.next
        return dummy.next #as head node might get deleted.
