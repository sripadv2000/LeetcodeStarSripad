61) Nth Root of a Number Using Binary Search

For finding nth root of any integer, we use Binary Search.
BS is not only limited to finding elements in an array.
Binary Search can be implemented on any search space which is monotonic in nature.
It can either be linearly increasing or decreasing.
Code:
def multiply(number,n):
    ans=1
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        ans=ans*number
    return ans

def getNthRoot(n,m):
    low=1
    high=m
    eps= 1e-3

    while((high-low)>eps):
        mid = (low+high)/2
        if(multiply(mid,n)<m):
            low=mid
        else:
            high=mid
    return low

n,m = map(int,input().split())
print(getNthRoot(n,m))

print(pow(m,(1/n)))
