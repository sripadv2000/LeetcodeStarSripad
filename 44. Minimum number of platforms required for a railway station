44) Minimum number of platforms required for a railway station
P: https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/minimum-platforms-1587115620/1#

If asked in a interview, ask whether the starting times are sorted or not, because the ending times will be in correspondence to the staring time.
Sort the start and end arrays individually in ascending order. It might occur that the start and departure time of a train might be jumbled,
i.e. may be present at different indexes.
We don't care about the order because we just need one instance where 
maximum platforms are occupied. That is what matters to us.
Then take 2 variables, platform and maximum.
Platform takes count of how many platforms are occupied at any instance.
if(platform>maximum):
    maximum=platform
TC: O(2NlogN)+O(2N); SC:O(1)
2NlogN to sort the 2 arrays and 2N because we are using 2-pointer approach to find the minimum prlatforms required.
SC:O(1) as we are not using any externaal space.
Code:
class Solution:
    def minimumPlatform(self,n,arr,dep):
        arr.sort()
        dep.sort()
        platform=1
        maxi=1
        i=1
        j=0
        while(i<n and j<n):
            if(arr[i]<=dep[j]):
                platform+=1 #(<=)because, if the arrival time of one train equals the departure time of other, we need one more platform.
                i+=1
            elif(arr[i]>dep[j]):
                platform-=1
                j+=1
            if(platform>maxi):
                maxi=platform
        return maxi
