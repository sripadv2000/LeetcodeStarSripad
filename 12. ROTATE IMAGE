12) Rotate Image
    P: https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-image/
	Method-1: It is by shifting element by element to its position.
	Method-2: We make use of transpose. If we transpose a matrix, rows becomes columns and columns become rows.
	After the transpose, it is just reversing the rows one by one to get the desired rotated matrix.
  Code:
  class Solution:
    def rotate(self, matrix: List[List[int]]) -> None:
        n = len(matrix) #len(matrix) = len(matrix[0])
        for i in range(n):
	        for j in range(i):
		        matrix[i][j], matrix[j][i] = matrix[j][i], matrix[i][j]
        for i in range(n):
            matrix[i]=reversed(matrix[i])
	Method-3: Its just reversing the matrix(last row becomes first and vice-versa) and taking transpose.
Code:
class Solution:
    def rotate(self, matrix: List[List[int]]) -> None:
        n = len(matrix) #len(matrix) = len(matrix[0])
        matrix[::] = matrix[::-1]
        for i in range(n):
	        for j in range(i):
		        matrix[i][j], matrix[j][i] = matrix[j][i], matrix[i][j]
        """
        Do not return anything, modify matrix in-place instead.
