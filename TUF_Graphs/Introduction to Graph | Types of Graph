A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges.
A Graph consists of a finite set of vertices(or nodes) and set of Edges which connect a pair of nodes.
The pair is ordered because (u, v) is not the same as (v, u) in case of a directed graph(di-graph). 
The pair of the form (u, v) indicates that there is an edge from vertex u to vertex v. The edges may contain weight/value/cost.
Topics covered in this video:
- Directed and Undirected Graph.
- In undirected graph, Total degrees of all the nodes = 2 x No. of edges
- In diected graphs, there is indegree and outdegree.
- Path in a graph
- Cyclic graphs
